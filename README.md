# Feedyou fork of Microsoft Bot Framework WebChat

Embeddable web chat control for the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://www.botframework.com) using the [DirectLine](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/directline3/) API. This repo is customized fork of [BotBuilder-WebChat](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat) by [Feedyou](https://feedyou.agency). This features were added by Feedyou in comparsion with `BotBuilder-WebChat`:

- show typing indicator on startup until the first message is recieved
- increase typing indicator timeout from 3 to 20 seconds
- show `imBack` buttons only for the last activity
- send backchannel event on startup which could be used instead of `conversationUpdate` event
- ability to pass some `userData` to bot using backchannel mechanism's `channelData` prop
- preset some default values in `<App>` component - for example generate `user.id` if not set
- support custom button click trigger for restarting conversation (`startOverTrigger` prop)
- make emoticons compatible using [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji)
- configurable style themes (currently only `theme.mainColor` prop)
- auto show upload button when `inputHint` property of last incoming activity was `expectingUpload`
- force intro dialog ID using `introDialog.id` property
- option `disableInputWhenNotNeeded` to disable input after messages with `inputHint==='ignoringInput`

## How to add Web Chat to your website

### What you will get from Feedyou

These are configuration values you will get from Feedyou during WebChat implemenation phase.

- `DirectLine secret` is used for authentication
- `Bot ID` is string in format `feedbot-*`
- `Bot name` will be shown as author name of messages from bot

Please paste these values to places marked by `...` in examples.

### What you will need to do on your website

Include `botchat.css`, `botchat-es5.js` (from our https://cdn.feedyou.ai/webchat/latest/... CDN) and following code into your website and paste required values you got from Feedyou. It will create expandable webchat in bottom right corner for you.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="https://cdn.feedyou.ai/webchat/latest/botchat.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://cdn.feedyou.ai/webchat/latest/botchat-es5.js"></script>
    <script>
      BotChat.App({
        directLine: { secret: '...' },
        bot: { id: 'feedbot-...', name: '...' }
        theme: { mainColor: "#e51836" },
        header: { text: "Chatbot", textWhenCollapsed: "Click for chatbot!" }
        // SEE "Advanced configuration" SECTION FOR MORE OPTIONS
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

> If you don't want to use polyfills for older browsers, you can use `botchat.js` instead of default `botchat-es5.js`.

If you want to make the expansion logic by yourself or you want to put bot directly into some existing element on your page, you can check out our examples:

- [/samples/feedyou/code.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/code.html) show the most simple way how to inject webchat into your page which you can also use with GTM or some other tag manager
- [/samples/feedyou/embed.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/embed.html) when you want to embed bot into given element of your page
- [/samples/feedyou/expandable.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/expandable.html) when you want to make expansion logic by yourself (note that `BotChat` component is initialized only after chat window is expanded, so bot is not triggered for users who not open chat)
- [/samples/feedyou/full.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/full.html) when webchat should be the main element on the page
- [/samples/feedyou/persistent.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/persistent.html) special configuration which allows to persist bot history between page reloads (by disabling WebSocket and using HTTP pooling instead)

#### Advanced configuration

You can use following optional settings during `BotChat.App` call:

```javascript
bot: {
  id: string,
  name?: string
},
user?: {
  id?: string,
  name?: string
},
directLine: {
  secret: string,
  conversationId?: string,
  webSocket?: boolean = true
},
theme?: {
  mainColor?: string,
  enableScreenshotUpload?: boolean
},
header?: {
  text?: string,
  textWhenCollapsed?: string,
},
introDialog?: {
  id?: string // overrides default bot dialog which is started when user opens webchat
},
locale?: 'cs' | 'en' | 'sk' | 'sr' | 'hu' = 'cs',
userData?: object, // allows to preset some data we already know about user (email, phone, etc.)
startOverTrigger?: (trigger: () => void) => void, // can be used to binding onclick event on element which can be used to restart conversation
onConversationStarted?: (callback: (conversationId: string) => void) => void, // can be used to store conversationId for new conversations (useful for history persistence)
disableInputWhenNotNeeded?: boolean = false, // disables input after messages with `inputHint==='ignoringInput`
autoExpandTimeout?: number = null // auto expand in milliseconds (only in case when no element specified as second argument of BotChat.App())
openUrlTarget?: 'new' | 'same' | 'same-domain' // allows to change target of opening URLs from bot
```

<!---
* `/samples/standalone` has a slightly more sophisticated version of this code, great for testing
* You can reference to latest release like this, [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/botchat.js). Make sure you use the same version for both `botchat.css` and `botchat.js`.
   * You can also reference to a previously published build, for example, [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.11.4/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.11.4/botchat.js).
   * Or if you want to try out latest fixes as on our GitHub `master` branch, you can use [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.13.1-master.ea2166a/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.13.1-master.ea2166a/botchat.js). For all version information, you can find it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botframework-webchat?activeTab=versions).
* Don't want to depend on a CDN? Download the files and serve them up from your own website.
* Want to run a custom build of Web Chat? Clone this repo, [alter it](#customizing-web-chat), [build it](#building-web-chat), and reference your built `botchat.css` and `botchat.js` files.
* Go to the next level with [Advanced Web Chat](#advanced-web-chat)
* Running Web Chat inline may not work for some web pages. Read on for a solution.

### URL parameters

WebChat looks for following parameters in the URL when implemented on any page:

- `#feedbot-test-mode` sets `testMode: true` into the `userData` object enables test mode in the chatbot for given user
- `#feedbot-intro-dialog` overrides default bot dialog which is started when user opens webchat and also value set by `introDialog.id` in the webchat settings

### Window events

WebChat is listening for following custom events on global `window` object:

- `feedbot:trigger-dialog` starts selected dialog specified in `dialog` property of `CustomEvent` (for example `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('feedbot:trigger-dialog', { detail: 'package-status' }))`)
- `feedbot:start-over` restarts conversation, which is the same behavior as `startOverTrigger` callback in config above (for example `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('feedbot:start-over'))`)

If support of Internet Explorer is required, please provide use [fallback](https://gomakethings.com/custom-events-in-internet-explorer-with-vanilla-js/) to support custom event creation there.

### Advanced customization

If you want to use WebChat directly as the component in your React app or you just want to customize it more than described above, check out the [advanced README](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/README-ADVANCED.md) or contact [Feedyou](mailto:hello@feedyou.agency) directly.
